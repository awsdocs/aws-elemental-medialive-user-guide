# Inputs<a name="inputs"></a>

An *input* is a video asset that is to be transcoded and packaged\. It may be associated with an input security group, which provides protection to the input, and with a channel, which provides details about the transcoding and packaging to perform\. 

AWS Elemental MediaLive supports different types of stream and file inputs \(for example, RTP and HLS\)\. The service also provides two ways to ingest the inputs, either through a push model or a pull model\.
