# Maintenance windows<a name="maintenance"></a>

AWS Elemental MediaLive routinely performs maintenance on the underlying systems to ensure their security, reliability, and operational performance\. During these maintenance events, channels might need to be restarted\.

To view the channels that require maintenance, use the MediaLive console or AWS Health Events in your Personal Health Dashboard\.

You can select the day and time that maintenance events will occur\. This is called a *maintenance window* and is used every time a maintenance event is required\. If you need to change the day and time, the maintenance window can be edited\. 

You can also manually restart the channels that require maintenance\. If you don't set a maintenance window, and don't restart manually, AWS sets the maintenance window\. We recommend you set a maintenance window for each channel that requires maintenance\.
