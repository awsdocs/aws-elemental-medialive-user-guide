# Create the channel<a name="ips-create-channel-tips"></a>

This section is a supplement to the information in [Creating a channel from scratch](creating-channel-scratch.md)\. It provides information that applies specifically to creating a channel that contains multiple input attachments\.

Note the following points, and then follow the steps for creating a channel as described in [Creating a channel from scratch](creating-channel-scratch.md)\.

## Channel and input details pane<a name="ips-channel-specifications-section"></a>

On the **Channel and input details **pane for the channel, in the [Input specifications](input-specification.md)section, set up each option to meet or exceed the most demanding of your inputs\.

## Input attachments pane<a name="ips-channel-input-attachment-section"></a>

On the **Input attachments **pane for the channel, set up the input attachments for the [inputs that you created](ips-create-inputs-tips.md)\.

**To set up each input attachment**

1. Choose **Add **in the **Input attachments **pane\. 

1. Choose an input\. Enter the name that you decided on when you [planned the attachments](ips-step-plan-attachments.md)\. 

1. Choose **Confirm** to display fields for general settings, for video selector fields, audio selector fields, and captions selector fields\. 

1. Complete these fields as appropriate\.

Note the following points:
+ Attach all the inputs that you identified\. If you omit an input, you won't be able to attach it unless you stop the channel\.

  You should have already [identified the first input attachment](ips-order-switches.md)\. Make sure that you create this attachment first, so that it appears first in the channel\. 
+ Add the remaining input attachments in any order\. 
+ In the **General input settings** section for each input attachment, set **Source end behavior** to work correctly\. For information, see [Handling the transition when the next input is fixed or immediate](ips-transition-gap.md)\.
+ In the **General input settings** section for each input attachment, set up the following sets of fields according to the plan that you created when you [planned the attachments](ips-step-plan-attachments.md): 
  + The fields in **Video selector**
  + The fields in**Audio selectors**
  + The fields in **Caption selectors** 

## Output groups<a name="ips-channel-outputgroups-section"></a>

On the **Output groups **pane for the channel, follow the regular procedure to create all the output groups that you identified in [Step 1: Plan the outputs](ips-step-plan-outputs.md)\.
