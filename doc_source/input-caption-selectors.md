# Input settingsâ€”Caption selectors<a name="input-caption-selectors"></a>

If you want to extract captions from the input or to specify an external file as the source of the captions, this section is required\. You create one or more captions selectors to identify the captions to extract\. Typically, you identify different languages in each selector, but you could also identify different captions formats\. 

For each captions item that you want to extract or include, choose the **Add captions** selector\. For detailed information about setting up input for captions, see [Working with captions](captions.md), specifically [Step 1: Create captions selectors in the input](identify-captions-in-the-input.md)\.
