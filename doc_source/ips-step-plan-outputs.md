Plan the output side of the channel in the normal way:
+ Identify all the output groups\.
+ Identify the types of outputs in each output group\.
+ Identify the video, audio, and captions encodes for each output\.

For more information, see [Preparing the upstream and downstream systems in the MediaLive workflow](container-planning-workflow.md)\. 

After you have completed this step, you have a list of output group types, and a list of the number of video, audio, and captions outputs in each output group\.
