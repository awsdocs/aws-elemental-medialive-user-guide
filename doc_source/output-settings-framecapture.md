By default, the output is set up with one video encode\. This is the only encode that a frame capture output can contain\. Therefore, you can't add audio or captions encodes or more video encodes\.

For information about the fields in the video encode, see [Step 6: Set up the video encode](creating-a-channel-step6.md)\.
