## Example of a splice insert with a fixed start time<a name="json-splice-insert-example"></a>

This example of a request creates an action for a splice\_insert with a UTC start time of 20:42:04\.000\. It also has an `ActionName` that perhaps references an ad avail from your database, a unique integer for the splice event ID, and a duration of 1,350,000 kHz ticks \(15 seconds\)\.

## Example of a splice insert as a follow<a name="json-splice-insert-example2"></a>

This example of a request creates an action for a splice\_insert to be inserted after the input switch called nature\-doco\-003 ends\. The action has an `ActionName` that perhaps references an ad avail from your database, a unique integer for the splice event ID, and a duration of 1,350,000 kHz ticks \(15 seconds\)\.

Follow mode for a SCTE\-35 message is useful when you want an ad avail to occur as soon as an input finishes, but you don't know when that will happen\.
