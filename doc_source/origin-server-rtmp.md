# RTMP output group<a name="origin-server-rtmp"></a>

Follow this procedure if you [determined](identify-downstream-system.md) that you will create an RTMP output group\. 

You and the operator of the downstream system must agree about the destination for the output of the RTMP output group\. You will need this information when you [create the MediaLive channel](creating-rtmp-output-group.md)\.

You must follow the procedure for each RTMP output, if the RTMP output group has more than one output\. Each output within the group has its own destination\.

**To arrange setup of the destination**

1. If the RTMP server is a social media site, the host of the site might have instructions that can supplement the following information\. Obtain these instructions\.

1. Decide if you need two destinations for the output: 
   + If the MediaLive channel is a [standard channel](plan-redundancy.md), you need two destinations\.
   + If the MediaLive channel is a single\-pipeline channel, you need one destination\. 

1. Make sure that the RTMP operator sets up to expect MediaLive output at one or two inputs on the RTMP server, as appropriate\.

1. Obtain the following information from the RTMP operator:
   + The protocol for MediaLive to useâ€”RTMP or RTMPS\.
   + The user name and password to access the downstream system, if the downstream system requires authenticated requests\. Note that these user credentials relate to user authentication, not to the protocol\. User authentication is about whether the downstream system will accept your request\. The protocol is about whether the request is sent over a secure connection\.
   + IP address\.
   + Port number\.
   + Application name\. Also called *app name*\.
   + Stream name\. Also called *application instance* or *app instance* or *stream key*\.

     The operator might give you the application name and stream name as separate pieces of data\. Or they might give you a complete path in the format **string/string**\. In this case, the first string is the application name and the second string is the stream name\.

   Here is an example of the information that the operator will give you:

   `rtmp://203.0.113.28:80/xyz/ywq7b`

   `rtmp://203.0.113.17:80/xyz/ywq7b`

   Where `xyz` is the application name, and `ywq7b` is the stream name\.

   In this example, the two URLs have different IP addresses but the same application name/stream name portion\. Your RTMP server might follow a different rule\.
