# Next steps<a name="plan-channel-next"></a>

You have now planned the channel\. 

You have mapped your sources to your outputs\. On the output side, you have identified the video, audio and captions *encodes* that you want\. And on the source side, you have identified the specific video, audio, and captions *assets* that can produce those encodes\.

You have then organized these encodes into outputs within the output groups that you identified when you [planned your workflow](identify-downstream-system.md)\.

You have also identified the opportunities for sharing assets among different outputs within an output group or among different output groups\.

You are now ready to create the channels\. See [Working with AWS Elemental MediaLive channels](container-channel.md)\.
