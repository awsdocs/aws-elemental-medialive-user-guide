# Step 1: Identify the output encodes<a name="planning-encodes"></a>

When you prepared the downstream systems, you [identified the output groups](identify-downstream-system.md) that you need\. Now, as part of the planning of the channel, you must identify the encodes to include in each output group you have decided to create\. An *encode* refers to the audio, video, or captions streams in the output\.
