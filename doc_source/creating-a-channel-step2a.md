As soon as you attach the input on the **Attach** input pages, the **Input attachment** section closes and the **General input settings** section appears\. You must complete these fields to configure the input\.

**To configure the input**

1. Complete the fields as required\. See the topics links below\. For details about a field, choose the **Info** link next to the field on the MediaLive console:

   + However, if you want to include audio and captions in the outputs, you must complete the **Audio selectors** and **Caption selectors** sections; the defaults do not specify enough information\.

1. If you are setting up the channel with multiple inputs, add more inputs to the channel\. For guidelines about implementing input switching, see [Input switching in AWS Elemental MediaLive](scheduled-input-switching.md)\.

1. When ready, go to the [next step](creating-a-channel-step3.md)\.
