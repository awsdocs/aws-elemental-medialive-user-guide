# Guidance for setting up for custom paths<a name="hls-custom-paths-guidance"></a>

Following is some guidance for using the *base URL* fields for different downstream systems\.

**Setting up for custom paths if you control the downstream system**

You might control the downstream system\. For example, the downstream systems might be Amazon S3 or MediaStore connected to Amazon CloudFront\. Your handling of the HLS files might require that you move one or more of the sets of files around\. In this case, you could complete these *base URL* fields to match the paths of the final location of the files\.

**Setting up for custom paths if the downstream packager is MediaPackage**

If the downstream package is MediaPackage, leave the **Base URL** fields empty\. MediaPackage doesnâ€™t use this information\.

**Setting up for custom paths if you use a third\-party downstream system**

If you use a third\-party downstream system, the downstream system must tell you whether to complete these **Base URL** fields\.
