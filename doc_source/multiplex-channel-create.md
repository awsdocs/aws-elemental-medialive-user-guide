# Creating a channel<a name="multiplex-channel-create"></a>

The channel attached to a program is a regular channel in which the output group is always a multiplex output group\. 

In a new multiplex, you can create a channel as soon as its program has been successfully created\. 

If a multiplex is running, you don't have to stop the multiplex to add a channel\. You can add a channel to a running multiplex\. 

For information about special steps for completing the fields in a channel in a multiplex, see [Step 5: Create the channels](setting-up-multiplex.md#create-multiplex-channels-step)\.
