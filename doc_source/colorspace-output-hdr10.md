# Converting color space to HDR10<a name="colorspace-output-hdr10"></a>

This option is available only when the output codec is H\.265 \(HEVC\)\. 

To convert all the color space to HDR10, in **Codec details**, expand **Color space** and set **Color space settings** to **HDR10**\.The following table shows how MediaLive handles each type of color space it encounters\.


|  Color space metadata that MediaLive encounters  |  How MediaLive handles the color space  | 
| --- | --- | 
|  Content in an SDR color space  | Converts the content to the new color space and brightness function\. The conversion maps the pixels to code values that represent the same color as the original code values\.Changes the color space metadata to specify the new color space\.Changes the brightness metadata to specify the new standard\.If you complete **Max CLL** and **Max FALL**, the values in those fields are inserted in the display metadata\.There is no change to the pixel values of the content\. In effect, this conversion fits the smaller SDR color space into the larger HDR color space and maps the pixels to new code values that represent the same color\. The conversion doesn't actually make the existing color richer\. Typically, you wouldn't choose to convert SDR to HDR if all the content in all inputs is in SDR\. This is because MediaLive doesn't make any change to the pixel values of the content\. A conversion from SDR to HDR would typically occur only when you have content that is both HDR and SDR and you choose to convert from HLG to HDR10\. Both the HLG content and the SDR content are converted, although, as we just stated, the conversion has no effect on the color of the SDR content\.  | 
| Content in HDR10 |  Doesn't touch the color space \(the pixel values\) in the output\. Passes through the color space metadata\. Passes through the brightness metadata and the display metadata\.   | 
| Content in HLG | There is no conversionâ€”there is no change to the pixel values of the content\. This is appropriate because HDR10 and HLG use the same color space \(they are different only in brightness function and display metadata\)\. Converts the content to the new brightness function\. Changes the color space metadata to the new color space\.Change the brightness metadata to specify the new standard\.If you complete **Max CLL** and **Max FALL**, MediaLive inserts the values from those fields into the display metadata\.  | 
| Content marked with an unknown or unsupported color space | No change to the pixel values of the content\.Leaves the content as marked with the unknown color space\.Passes through any brightness metadata and display metadata\. | 
|  Content with no color space metadata  |  No change to the pixel values of the content\. Leaves the content as unmarked\.  Passes through any brightness metadata and display metadata\.  |
