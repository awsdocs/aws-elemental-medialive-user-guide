# Monitoring a channel using Amazon CloudWatch Logs<a name="monitoring-with-logs"></a>

MediaLive produces channel logs that contain detailed information about activity in a channel\. The logs provide a sequential description of activity that occurs in the channel\. These logs can be useful when the information in alerts \([Monitoring a channel or multiplex using Amazon CloudWatch Events](monitoring-via-cloudwatch.md)\) does not provide enough information to resolve an issue on the channel\.
