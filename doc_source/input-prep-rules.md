# Rules and limits for input prepare<a name="input-prep-rules"></a>

**One active prepare at a time**  
The schedule can contain any number of input prepare actions, but only one input prepare action can be active at one time\. 

**Start time at least 10 seconds in advance**  
Set up each input prepare action so that it starts at least 10 seconds before the associated switch\.

**No RTMP pull inputs**  
A channel cannot have both RTMP pull input and the input prepare feature enabled\. \(RTMP push inputs are acceptable\.\) You must choose which feature is more importantâ€”the input prepare or the RTMP pull input\. 
+ If you want to use the input prepare feature and the channel already has an RTMP pull input, you must first remove the input\.
+ If you want to add an RTMP pull input and the channel already has input prepare actions in the schedule, see [Enabling and disabling the input prepare feature](input-prep-enable.md)\.
