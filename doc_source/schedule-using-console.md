# Working with the Schedule \(Console\)<a name="schedule-using-console"></a>

You can use the AWS Elemental MediaLive console to create or delete any of the [schedule actions](x-actions-in-schedule.md) in a channel\. You can work with the schedule when the channel is running or when it is idle\. 

The actions are executed in the channel when the channel is running\. The channel executes the actions at the start times that you specify\. 

The console provides two views for working with actions:
+ A list view that lists actions in tabular format
+ A timeline view that shows a timeline representation of the actions

In either view, you can do the following:
+ Create individual actions
+ Delete individual actions
+ Delete several actions in one request \(a batch command\)
+ View the actions currently in the schedule
