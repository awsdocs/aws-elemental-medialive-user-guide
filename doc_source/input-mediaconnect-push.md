# Channel inputâ€”MediaConnect push input<a name="input-mediaconnect-push"></a>

To verify that the input is set up correctly, look at the **MediaConnect flows** section\. It shows the ARNs of the AWS Elemental MediaConnect flows that are the source for this input\. These ARNs were automatically generated when you created the input:
+ If the channel is set up as a standard channel, two ARNs are generated\.
+ If the channel is set up as a single\-pipeline channel, one ARN is generated\. 

For example:

**arn:aws:mediaconnect:us\-west\-1:111122223333:flow:1bgf67:sports\-event\-A** and

**arn:aws:mediaconnect:us\-west\-1:111122223333:flow:9pmlk76:sports\-event\-B**
