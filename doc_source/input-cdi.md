# Channel inputâ€”CDI VPC push input<a name="input-cdi"></a>

To verify that the input is set up correctly, look at the **Input destinations** section\. It shows the two locations on MediaLive that the upstream system will push the source to when the channel is running\. These locations were automatically generated when you created the input:
+ If the channel is set up as a standard channel, two locations are generated\. 
+ If the channel is set up as a single\-pipeline channel, one location is generated\. 

For example:

**10\.99\.39\.23:5000**

**192\.0\.2\.54:5000**
