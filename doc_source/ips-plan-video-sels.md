# Plan the video selectors<a name="ips-plan-video-sels"></a>

You can extract only one video from each input\. If a given input contains more than one video, then create a video selector to extract that specific video\. If a given input contains only one video, there is no need to create a video selector\. AWS Elemental MediaLive automatically finds and extracts that video\. On the output side, MediaLive automatically uses that one video asset\.
