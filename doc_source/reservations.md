# Working with Reservations in AWS Elemental MediaLive<a name="reservations"></a>

You can purchase a reservation for the processing of resources that you are billed for: input processing, output processing, and add\-ons such as codec licenses\. Each reservation gives you a reduced rate for the processing of the relevant resources\. 

A reservation is a one\-year commitment to a particular input or output configuration\. The reservation is allocated and billed on a monthly basis through that year\. 

You pay an hourly rate \(which is lower than the per\-minute rate\) for a pool of minutes that your channels consume for a month\. 

For information on charges for reservations, see [the MediaLive price list](https://aws.amazon.com/medialive/pricing/)\.
