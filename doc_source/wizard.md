# Using the workflow wizard<a name="wizard"></a>

The AWS Elemental MediaLive workflow wizard lets you quickly get an MediaLive channel up and running\. The wizard creates a channel and inputs \(if they don't already exist\)\. But it also creates related resources in other services \(such as a channel in AWS Elemental MediaPackage\)\. So it helps with the entire workflow, not just with the MediaLive portion\.
