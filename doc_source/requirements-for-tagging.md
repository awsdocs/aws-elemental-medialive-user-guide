# Requirements for AWS Resource Groupsâ€”tagging<a name="requirements-for-tagging"></a>

When users create channels, inputs, or input security groups, they can optionally attach tags to the resource during creation\. Typically, your organization has a policy to tag or to omit tags\. There are two services that control permissions for tagging, for two different scenarios:
+ The ability to tag during channel creation is controlled by actions within AWS Elemental MediaLive\. See [Requirements for AWS Elemental MediaLive features](requirements-for-medialive.md)\. 
+ The ability to modify tags in existing resources is controlled by actions within Resource Group Tagging\. See [Working with Tag Editor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/tag-editor.html) in [Getting Started with the AWS Management Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/getting-started.html)\.
