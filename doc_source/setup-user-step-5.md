# Step 5: Create or Modify each IAM User<a name="setup-user-step-5"></a>

Any person who is an administrator can perform this step\. Follow this procedure when setting up users for production\. After the initial setup, perform this procedure whenever you need to set up a new user\.

After you create the groups and attach the policies to each group, you must create the users and attach each to the appropriate group\.

This procedure describes how to set up the user for console access, but not for AWS CLI or AWS SDK access\. To set up for programmatic access, see [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/)\.
