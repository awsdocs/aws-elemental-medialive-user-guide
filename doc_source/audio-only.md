# Audio\-only outputs<a name="audio-only"></a>

You can set up a MediaLive channel with an output group that contains only audio\. You can create a channel with these combinations of output groups:
+ One audio\-only output group\.
+ Several audio\-only output groups\.
+ One or more audio\-only output groups and other regular \(video\-plus\-audio\) output groups\.

Set up the channel in the [usual way](creating-channel-scratch.md), using the guidelines in this section to set up the inputs, outputs, and encodes for the audio\-only output groups\.

**Note**  
The information in this section assumes that you are familiar with the general steps for creating a channel, as described in [Creating a channel from scratch](creating-channel-scratch.md)\.
