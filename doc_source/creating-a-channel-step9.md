# Step 9: Save the channel<a name="creating-a-channel-step9"></a>

To save \(create\) the channel, choose **Create channel** in the navigation pane\. 

You can save the channel only after you have configured and created everything that you require\. As soon as you save the channel, MediaLive validates the configuration of the channel and displays messages for any errors\. You can't save a draft of the channel, and you can't save a channel that contains error messages\.

To find your newly created channel, in the navigation pane, choose **Channel**\. \(The navigation pane might be collapsed\. To open it, choose the menu icon in the upper\-left corner of the console\)\.

The **Channel** pane appears and shows the newly created channel in the list of channels\. The state changes to **Creating**, and then to **Ready**\.
