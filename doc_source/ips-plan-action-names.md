# Plan the action names<a name="ips-plan-action-names"></a>

You should plan the names for the input switch action\. Action names must be unique in the schedule for each channel\.

For a static input, you might want to name the actions so that they indicate which input applies\. For example, for each switch to the input named static\-live\-studio\-feed:
+ `static-live-studio-feed-action-1`
+ `static-live-studio-feed-action-2`
+ `static-live-studio-feed-action-3`

For the input switch action for a dynamic input, you might use the input name \(or part of the name\) plus the URL \(or part of the URL\) of the file\. For example:
+ `dyn-preroll-EN-FR-ES-DE-ad-ward-cars-1`
+ `dyn-preroll-EN-FR-ES-DE-ad-zel-cafe`
+ `dyn-preroll-EN-FR-ES-DE-ad-ward-cars-2`
