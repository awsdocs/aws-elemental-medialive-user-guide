# Step 3: Insert the overlay<a name="mgi-insert-overlay"></a>

When you are ready, you can create an action in the channel schedule to activate \(insert\) the overlay\. You can create the action at any time â€“ before the channel has started or while it is already running\.

The schedule is a timetable that is attached to each channel\. The schedule is designed to let you specify actions to perform on the channel at a specific time\. You can set up the action so that a motion graphic is active for a specific time, or so that it is active indefinitely\. In both cases, you can stop the overlay at any time by creating a deactivate action\.
