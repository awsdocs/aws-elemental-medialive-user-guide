# Creating a frame capture output group<a name="creating-framecapture-output-group"></a>

A *frame capture* output lets you capture the video as a series of files, with each file containing one JPEG image\. For example, the output might capture every 10th output frame\. You save the files to an S3 bucket\.

When you [planned the workflow for your channel](identify-downstream-system.md), you might have determined that you want to include a frame capture output group\. A frame capture group always sends output to an S3 bucket\.
