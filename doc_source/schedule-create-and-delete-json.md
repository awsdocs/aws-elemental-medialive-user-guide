# JSON payload for combining create and delete<a name="schedule-create-and-delete-json"></a>

To combine a batch of creates and deletes, include both a `Creates` section and a `Deletes` section in the JSON payload\. 

In this example, the payload in the `Deletes` section removes an action to activate an image overlay because it has an incorrect start time\. The action is named `overlay-21`\. The payload in the `Creates` section inserts that action again, this time with the correct start time\.

Even though the `Creates` section appears first in the JSON payload, MediaLive always performs the delete actions first\. 

In this action, the delete action and the create action have the same `ActionName`\. The name is being reused because the batch is a "delete and replace\." But you could assign a different name to the create action\.
