# Color space versus video resolution<a name="color-space-vs-resolution"></a>

Color space refers to the range of color\. MediaLive supports the following color spaces:
+ SDR \(standard dynamic range\)
+ HDR \(high dynamic range\) color spaces

Resolution refers to the video pixel count\. MediaLive supports the following resolutions:
+ SD \(standard definition\)\.
+ HD \(high definition\)\.
+ UHD \(ultra\-high definition\)\. For UHD, MediaLive resolutions up to 4K\.

The following combinations of color space and resolution are typically used:
+ SDR color space can be associated with SD, HD, and UHD video\.
+ HDR color space can be associated with HD or UHD video\. 

HDR isn't typically associated with SD content, but MediaLive *does* support this combination\.
