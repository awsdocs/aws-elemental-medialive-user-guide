# Next steps<a name="plan-workflow-next"></a>

You have now planned your workflow, starting from the outputs your required\. You then worked back to the sourceâ€”assessing the upstream system, obtaining information about the sources, and setting up the source inputs\. You then returned to the output side, coordinating with the downstream system for delivery of the outputs that MediaLive will produce\.

As part of this planning, you have already created some of the resources that you need for the workflow:
+ Inputs for the sources
+ Input security groups, for some inputs\.

You are now ready to design the channel that is the key resource in your workflow\. See [Planning the channel in the MediaLive workflow](planning-the-channel-in-workflow.md)\.
