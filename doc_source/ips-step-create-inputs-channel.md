# Step 6: Create the inputs and channel<a name="ips-step-create-inputs-channel"></a>

After you perform the planning in steps 1 to 5, you are ready to create the inputs and create the channel\.

In a multiple\-input channel, all the inputs must already exist in the channel before you start the channel\. You can't add an input while the channel is running\. Therefore, you should identify all the inputs that you might need until the next planned maintenance period\.
