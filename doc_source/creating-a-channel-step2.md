# Step 2: Attach inputs to the channel<a name="creating-a-channel-step2"></a>

When you planned your workflow, you should have coordinated with the upstream system for delivery of the source content\. As part of [that procedure](step-setting-up-upstream.md), you created an input for each content source\.

You must now attach the input to the channel\.

You can attach multiple inputs to the channel\. For detailed information about setting up a channel with more than one input, see [Input switching in AWS Elemental MediaLive](scheduled-input-switching.md)\. There are specific rules about the number and type \(push versus pull, for example\) of inputs that you can attach to one channel\.
