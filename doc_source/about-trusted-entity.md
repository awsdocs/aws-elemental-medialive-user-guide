# About the trusted entity role<a name="about-trusted-entity"></a>

AWS Elemental MediaLive must be set up so that when a channel is running, MediaLive itself has access to perform operations on resources that belong to your organization's AWS account\. For example, your deployment might use AWS Elemental MediaStore as a source for files, such as blackout images, that MediaLive requires during processing\. For MediaLive to obtain these files, it must have read access to some or all containers in MediaStore\.

To perform the required operations on those resources, MediaLive must be set up as a *trusted entity* on your account\. 

MediaLive is set up as a trusted entity as follows: A role \(that belongs to your AWS account\) identifies MediaLive as a trusted entity\. The role is attached to one or more policies\. Each policy contains statements about allowed operations and resources\. The chain between the trusted entity, role, and policies makes this statement:

"MediaLive is allowed to assume this role in order to perform the operations on the resources that are specified in the policies\."

After this role is created, the role must be attached to a specified channel\. This attachment makes this statement:

"For this channel, MediaLive is allowed to assume this role in order to perform the operations on the resources specified in the policies\."

Creating this attachment at the channel level allows each channel to give MediaLive access to different operations and, especially, different resources\.
